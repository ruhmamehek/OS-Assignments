This chat system is implemented using unix sockets. 
There is a server which connects to multiple clients.
The server relays messages between clients.

Threads are created to handle each client independently.

Program usage:
To compile the program, enter the folder and use make all in the terminal.
To remove binaries, use make clean.


Testing of the program:
run the server program by typing ./server
Now open up clients in different terminals by typing ./client 
A user ID will be assigned to each client. 
The user will be prompted to enter a username.
Available options are printed.

Use BROADCAST to send a message to all clients, or else use MSG <Client ID> <message> to send individual messages.
If an invalid user is selected, user will see Client doesn't exist, as output
If the user enters an invalid input, he/she will be prompted.


Errors: 
Invalid users selected
Invalid input format
Other minor errors while sending/receiving messages, connecting socket, etc.
